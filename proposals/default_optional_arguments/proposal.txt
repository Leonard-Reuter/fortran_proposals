1. Introduction

This paper contains a proposal for Fortran 202y, to allow a programmer
to specify a default value for optional dummy arguments. This would
allow the programmer to then safely reference such variables in
expressions regardless of whether the actual argument is present or
not.

2. Problem

Currently, standard Fortran does not allow setting a default value for
optional arguments. Default value of an optional argument is the value
that the dummy argument would take if the corresponding actual argument
is not present. If declaring a dummy argument as optional, the user
must:

  * Explicitly test for the presence of the actual argument using the
    intrinsic function present();
  * Use a separate variable inside the procedure to assign the value
    because the optional dummy argument that is not present must not be
    referenced in expressions other than as actual argument to the
    intrinsic function present().

This example function illustrates the problem:

    real function quadratic(x, a, b, c)  
      ! returns a + b * x + c * x**2 if c is present 
      ! and a + b * x otherwise
      real, intent(in) :: x, a, b
      real, intent(in), optional :: c
      real :: c_tmp ! use another var. to reference the missing arg
      c_tmp = 0 ! default value if c is not present
      if (present(c)) c_tmp = c
      quadratic = a + b * x + c_tmp * x**2
    end function quadratic

For any dummy argument with the optional attribute, the programmer must
use the intrinsic function present() to check for the presence of the
argument. Furthermore, if the optional dummy argument is meant to be
used in multiple places in the procedure, the programmer is likely to
use the pattern from the example above, where a "temporary" variable is
declared and used in place of the dummy argument, which disconnects the
implementation from the user interface. Furthermore, this requires at
least 3 lines of code (declaration of c_tmp, initialization of c_tmp,
and testing for the presence of c) only to handle the scenario of a
missing optional argument.

This proposal seeks to address the issue that explicitly checking for
presence of the optional dummy argument and using a helper variable is
cumbersome and error-prone. The primary benefit of this feature is the
reduction in source code needed to handle optional arguments. This
benefit is even greater in scenarios where the optional argument is
used in many places in the procedure, and a helper variable is used for
its value instead. Reduction in needed source code would result in more
readable and more correct programs.  The secondary benefit of this is
programmer happiness, as working with optional arguments would require
less typing.

3. Proposed solution

As suggested by Van Snyder in 18-136r1, the problem could be solved by
allowing an optional argument to be initialized using a constant
expression. The optional argument would then only be initialized if the
corresponding actual argument is not provided by the caller. Example:

    real function quadratic(x, a, b, c)
      ! returns a + b * x + c * x**2 if c is present 
      ! and a + b * x otherwise
      real, intent(in) :: x, a, b
      real, intent(in), optional :: c = 0
      quadratic = a + b * x + c * x**2
    end function quadratic

In this snippet, we use the assignment operator (=) to specify the
default value of the optional dummy argument.

Like initializer, the optional argument can be assigned any constant 
expression, as defined in Section 10.1.12 of 18-007r1.

While there may be concerns that the same syntax is used to implicitly
set the save attribute for variables in procedures, there is no
conflict because the language prohibits dummy arguments from having an
initializer, or the save attribute. The change to the standard to allow
this feature would thus be to allow an optional dummy argument to have
an initializer, which would be triggered only when corresponding actual
argument is not passed by the caller.

This improvement has already been suggested by Van Snyder in 18-136r1,
has received votes in the user survey for 202X (see
https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=19530634&objAction=Open),
and appeared on Data subgroup's wishlist at meeting 215 (see 18-122r1).

4. Backward compatibility

This addition to the language would not break any existing standard
conforming Fortran program, and thus preserves Fortran's backward
compatibility.

5. Related behavior

5.1. present()

There are two possible behaviors of the function present() when an
initializer is provided.

The first behavior would be that the function present() always returns
.true. when the optional dummy argument has an initializer, and
independently of the fact that an actual argument is passed or not
by the caller. Therefore, with such a behavior, the function present()
becomes useless for optional arguments with a default value.

Example:

    real function foo(a, b)
      real, intent(in), optional :: a
      real, intent(in), optional :: b = 0
      print*, present(a)  !.true. if an actual argument is provided
                          !by the caller, .false. otherwise
      print*, present(b)  !always .true. due to the initializer
    end function foo

The second behavior would be that the function present() returns
.true. or .false. when an actual argument is passed or not by the
caller, and independently of the fact that the optional dummy
argument has, or hasn't an initializer.

A use case of this behavior of the function present() could be:

    real function foo(a, b)
      real, intent(in) :: a
      real, intent(in), optional :: b = 1.234
      if (present(b)) then
       ... !expensive input validation  here
      end if
      ...
    end function foo

5.2. intent(out)

There are several different possible behaviors for intent(out)
variables. One option is to disallow default values on optional
intent(out) variables. However, there are use cases where it is
desirable to return the value of a variable if a caller requests it,
without requiring the added logic of present() and "temporary"
variables described above.

Alternatively, we might treat intent(in) and intent(out) variables
identically, so that the following would be valid:

    real function foo(a)
      real, intent(out), optional :: a = 0
    end function foo

The benefit is that, just like proposed for intent(in) variables,
intent(out) variables would be usable regardless of whether the value
is actually passed back to the caller, removing the need for present()
and "temporary" variables. The complication is that a present
intent(out) variable is initially undefined, meaning the logic of
present() might still be necessary in this case. Furthermore, the behavior
suggested above where present() = .true. always for variables with a
specified default would not be desired for intent(out) variables.

A third option is that optional intent(out) variables with a specified
default are always initialized to that default, even when present,
rather than leaving them undefined.
