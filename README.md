# Fortran Proposals

This repository contains proposals for the Fortran Standard Committee.

## Workflow

1. Open a new issue with a new addition that you would like to see eventually included in the Fortran standard.

2. The issue will get discussed. Once the Fortran Committee meets, we will try to gather feedback and post it back to the issue.

3. If the issue receives

  a) negative feedback, then we will close the issue and we will have documented reasons why the idea got rejected. One can open a new issue, reference the closed issue and advocate why it should be revisited.

  b) positive feedback, we can start drafting a formal proposal to be submitted into [Documents](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/meeting) for the US committee. One has to find an advocate at the committee to advocate for the proposal. 

4. Getting the proposal through the Committee is a long process, with multiple approvals, formal requirements, specifications, edits to the standard, etc. We will document this step in more detail. During this process, we can document the latest status at the issue.
